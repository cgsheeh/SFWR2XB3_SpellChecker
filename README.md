# SFWR2XB3_SpellChecker
Java Spell Check client made for SFWR 2XB3 at McMaster University

This project was assigned as a Final Assignment for Sofwtare Engineering 2XB3, an experiential learning course about software engineering
practices and binding theory to those practices. The project was done in a team of three (Josh Hu and Nick Lago were other contributors),
and required the use of algorithms learned in 2C03 as well as design techniques learned in 2AA4. We used Red-Black BST's, Ternary
Search Tries and Heapsort. Use of a data set was also required, we chose a 650,000 word dictionary.
